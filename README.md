# IMPORTANT NOTE

The Digital Twins Graph Viewer in this repository was built for the Digital Twins early preview released in 2018. It is not compatible with the latest Azure Digital Twins service released in June 2020. For interacting with the Azure Digital Twins service, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/) for code samples.

**The code in this repository cannot be used with newly deployed Azure Digital Twins instances.**

# Introduction
This "Azure Digital Twins Graph Viewer" serves as a front-end to the [Azure Digital Twins](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/digital-twins/) spatial intelligence graph. It provides the following features:
- Visualizing the relationship between spaces, devices and sensors created in the Azure Digital Twins model
- Add, Edit and Delete Spaces, Devices and Sensors
- Changing the hierarchy by moving devices and spaces to different spaces
- Viewing basic properties and values of nodes
- Add a root space and IoT Hub as resource if the digital twin is empty
- Execute direct API calls to do all other digital twin interactions not implemented

The Graph Viewer is built to be a lightweight, adaptable front-end. It uses only client-side code and as such should be easy to deploy in different environments.

# Setup instructions

## Prerequisites
Before using the Graph Viewer, make sure that your deployment of Azure Digital Twins is complete. You will need to perform at least the following steps:
- Deploy an Azure Digital Twins instance to your Azure subscription.
- Create a root space in your topology. Under the samples directory, you can find an [example topology](samples/sample-topology.json) that you could use. 

For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Azure Digital Twins quick start guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/tutorial-facilities-setup)

## Creating an Azure AD application
In order to connect to Azure Digital Twins, the Graph Viewer must be registered in Azure Active Directory. 

1. Navigate to the Azure Active Directory page in the Azure portal.
2. Create a new application. Be sure to select Web/API and enter the exact URL you will deploy the Graph Viewer to.

3. After creation, take note of the Application ID guid. You will need that later. <br />
4. Go to Settings / Permissions and select the Azure Digital Twins service from the API list. Specify 'Read/Write Access' as the required permission.

5. Confirm the screen and click 'Grant permissions.' <br />
6. Click the 'Edit Manifest' button on the app blade. In the manifest, change the value for the 'oauth2AllowImplicitFlow' setting to 'true' and save.

## Prepare files
- Clone or download the repository files to your computer. 

## Deploy
Upload the files you've prepared in the previous step to your webserver. For example, you could create an Azure web app and deploy using FTP or VSTS. Alternatively, you could run this off a localhost webserver. Just make sure the reply-url in the AzureAD application has been set to the appropriate URL.
Running this locally by opening the files is not supported, since the login redirect from AzureAD would fail.

After deploying, you should be able to navigate to your deployment and sign in to the Graph Viewer.
When you open the Graph Viewer webpage, enter the following information in the text boxes:
- twinsInstanceRoot: This is the full URL of your Azure Digital Twins instance, ending in `azuresmartspaces.net`.
- tenant: This is the name or id of your Azure tenant, for example `6f68d89e-8f99-4798-8850-a5d557c3341e`
- clientId: This is the application id of the Azure Active Directory application you created in the previous step. It is formatted as a Guid.

## Run as Docker container

If you want to run the the Graph Viewer as Docker container on your machine, you can execute the following commands from within the root directory of the repository:

- `docker build . -t azure-digital-twins-viewer`
- `docker run -p 8080:80 azure-digital-twins-viewer`

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to view the Graph viewer locally.
